Gene-editing puzzle platformer for the original Game Boy, made with ZGB

Playable in browser on itch at https://selkkie.itch.io/acattag

Made for GBJam9 and GBCompo 21 in a week!

This was the first time I've written anything in C, so definitely don't use my code as an example as I have no idea what I'm doing!
